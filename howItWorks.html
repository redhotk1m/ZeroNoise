        <h3>ZeroNoise</h3>
        <div class="placement3">
        <p>
        ZeroNoise’s main objective is to make you feel comfortable while either browsing the web, or spending time on your computer in general.
        </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What does ZeroNoise do?</h3>
        <div class="placement3">
        <ul>
          <li>Lower volume when there’s a sudden jump in volume (E.g. Jump Scares)</li>
          <li>Blend contrast colors when there’s too much video flashing/blinking</li>
          <li>Easy to use, simple control panel</li>
          <li>Fully customizable</li>
          <li>Designed for you</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="placement3">
          <h3>Audio</h3>
          <p> 
          Let’s say you’re watching a video, and suddenly the volume increases by 50%. If you’re using a headset, this could really damage your ears. When this happens, ZeroNoise turns down the volume, so that the volume(Db) output of your speakers remain the same. This will give you a smooth and comfortable experience while using your computer. It’s also completely customizable in the settings.
          </p>
          </div>


        <div class="placement3">
        <h3>Video</h3>
          <p> 
             Ever watched a movie that made your Livingroom blink as if you were on a catwalk? Well let’s say you’re watching one right now. When such a scene occurs, ZeroNoise will take the two contrasting colors, and blend them. E.g. White and black blinking will be grey instead. You can also adjust the sensitivity in the settings, so that it doesn’t blink at all, it’s just e.g. black. There’s other features for laptops, where the screen brightness can be turned down as well.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="placement3">
        <h3>Technical details</h3>
        <p>
            Audio and video gets scanned before it gets played. If a youtube video has 0 dB output and it increases to 60dB within half a second, the user will get a warning before the video starts, or ZeroNoise will adjust your volume automatically, all depending on user settings.
 
            </p>
            <p>For the program to be able to know when to adjust the contrast, you’ll have to choose how sensitive you want it to be in the settings (or chose a certain preset when installing). The program “cuts” your screen into invisible boxes. The size of these boxes depends on your settings. If you have low sensitivity on, it will only activate if the entire screen is blinking. However, if you have set it to high sensitivity, it will cut your screen into 64 separate small screens, and if one of them is blinking, only that part of the screen will be adjusted. E.g. When a small computer screen in a movie Is blinking rapidly, most people might not mind this. However, extremely sensitive people could.

          <h3>Privacy</h3>
          <p>
            ZeroNoise does not store any information about the user. However, if you want, information about which websites you´re using, and how you want ZeroNoise to work on them, will be stored locally on your computer. This is so that ZeroNoise can get to know you, and work better for you. This is by default turned off. Upon installing ZeroNoise for the first time, you get the option to log into your windows account, but you don’t have to. This is so you can store your settings on the cloud. This is also turned off by default. If you want, you can send anonymous, encrypted data to ZeroNoise, so we can improve the program. Again, this too, is turned off by default. We take your privacy very seriously!
