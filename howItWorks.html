        <h2 class="center">How does it work?</h2>
        <div class="placement3">
        <p>ZeroNoise is a program you can <a href="shadowDownload.html"> download</a> on any windows computer. With it, you will get:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="placement3">
        <ol>
          <li>Control of your speaker and screen outputs.</li>
          <li>A variety of predetermined choices you can make regarding your computer's speaker and screen outputs with suggestions to fit your needs.</li>
          <li>Statistics about when the program was executed, and what it did at the particular time.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="placement3">
        <p> ZeroNoise works like a filter for both the computer screen and the sound outputs. When activated, the visual and auditory information has to go through ZeroNoise before it can be shown on the screen or heard through the speakers. Usually, ZeroNoise will do nothing, as the visuals and sounds are most often at acceptable levels. ZeroNoise will be executed in the background, waiting for an opportunity to give you a more pleasant computer experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="placement3">
        <p>When needed, ZeroNoise notices that the speaker or screen outputs might be getting uncomfortable or downright dangerous for the user, and it intervenes. With 'x' as the variable which the user is able to change, ZeroNoise can be set to "Do not output more than 'x' decibels", or "Do not increase the sound more than x% per second above x decibels", or a combination of these. The settings for the screen is "Do not alternate between more than x% in contrast per second". All of these are fully customizable, but have suggestions and presets for different types of user.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="placement4">
        <h3>ZeroNoise in practice</h3>
        <p>How does ZeroNoise work in practice? An example of ZeroNoise in action is as following: There is a video your are about to see that has a jump scare in it, with flashing lights and loud sounds. The user has set ZeroNoise to "Do not increase the sound by more than 20% per second above 60 decibels", "Do not output more than 90 decibels" and "Do not alternate between more than 100% in contrast per second". The video loads in the browser, and the information is sent directly to ZeroNoise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="placement3">
        <p>
        The beginning of the video shows some children playing in a garden. There are no high sounds or flashes. In the middle, the video contains a jump scare with a figure flashing quickly between black and white on the screen, and there is loud screech. ZeroNoise has already examined all of the information in the video, so it knows what is going to happen. Right when the jump scare comes, ZeroNoise plays the video, but the contrast between the black and the white is blurred, and is only able to go entirely between black and white during a full second. The result is a shade of gray, slowly going a bit more white and then a bit more black. The screech starts at 60 decibels and is slowly ramped up to 90 decibels. After the jump scare is over, the video returns to normal, and you will be able to watch the rest without interruption.</p>
