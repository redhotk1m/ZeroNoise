        <h1>The details of ZeroNoise</h1>
        <br>
        <p>ZeroNoise work like a filter for both the computer screen and the sound outputs. Before the visual and auditory information can be shown by the computer, it has to go through ZeroNoise. Usually, the visuals and the sounds will get an OK, and you will see everything like normal. But sometimes, the visuals or the sounds will be too extreme to go through, and it will be paused or dampened, depending on what the user wants it to do.</p><br>
        <p>An example of this could be a video that has a jump scare in it, with flashing lights and loud sounds. The user has set ZeroNoise to "dampen both sound and screen by 80%". The video loads in the browser, and the information is sent directly to ZeroNoise. The beginning of the video shows some children playing in the garden. There are no high sounds or flashes. In the middle, the video contains a jump scare with a figure flashing quickly on the screen and a loud screech. ZeroNoise has already downloaded all of the information in the video, so it knows what is going to happen. Right when the jump scare comes, ZeroNoise slows the flashing down to 80% of the original speed, and reduces the sound of the screech by 80%. When the jump scare is over, the video returns to normal.</p>
